        I need some placeholder text, so I'll put some stuff from our project proposal. This project will manage a car
        rental company website.The website will prompt customers to log in, browse, reserve, and pay for rental cars.
        The company also has a fleet of rental cars that must be maintained and may vary based on the user's selected
        location.We will be able to develop a functional full-stack website that can be modified through database
        queries. The database is built to be modular and easy to maintain as a DBA.
